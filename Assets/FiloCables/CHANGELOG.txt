# Change Log
All notable changes to “Filo - The cable simulator” will be documented in this file.

## [1.1]

### Added
- Dynamic joint merge/split system. This results in cables that can generate and remove contacts with new bodies at runtime.
- Attachment links can now generate/consume cable dynamically. This allows to change the cable rest length at runtime.
